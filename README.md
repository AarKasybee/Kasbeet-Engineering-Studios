# Kasbeet Engineering Studios
_Advancing applied engineering, systems design, and engineering education._

---
**Kasbeet Engineering Studios** is an independent engineering studio focused on  
**applied systems engineering, technical design, and advanced engineering education.**

This repository serves as the technical home for:
- Engineering design work
- Simulation and analysis projects
- Control, electrical, and embedded systems development
- Educational material supporting mathematically rigorous engineering modules

## What We Do

Kasbeet Engineering Studios operates at the intersection of **engineering practice** and **engineering education**.

We focus on problems where strong mathematical modeling, physical intuition, and disciplined system design matter most.

Our core areas include:

- **Control Systems & Signal Processing**  
  Modeling, stability analysis, feedback control, and system dynamics

- **Electrical & Electronic Systems**  
  Power systems, machines, electronics, and system-level integration

- **Computational Engineering**  
  Numerical methods, simulations, data analysis, and engineering software tools

- **Embedded & Mechatronic Systems**  
  Microcontrollers, real-time systems, and hardware–software integration

## Engineering Philosophy

Modern engineering fails when systems become black boxes.

Our approach is built on three principles:

1. **Model first** – Every system should be understood mathematically and physically before it is built  
2. **Design with structure** – Good engineering is systematic, not trial-and-error  
3. **Verify with data** – Simulations, tests, and measurements validate every assumption  

This philosophy is reflected in both our engineering projects and our teaching.

## Education & Technical Instruction

Alongside engineering work, Kasbeet Engineering Studios provides **high-level engineering tutoring** for mathematically demanding modules across the electrical and electronic engineering curriculum.

Over four years of instruction covering more than **500 hours**, we have supported students in:

- Engineering mathematics (calculus, differential equations, linear systems)
- Control theory and feedback systems
- Physics and electromagnetics
- Electrical machines and power systems
- Electronics, embedded systems, and computational tools

Our focus is not memorization — it is **engineering thinking**:
how to analyze systems, interpret equations, and solve unfamiliar problems.

## Repository Structure

This repository will contain:

- 📁 **/projects** — Engineering design, modeling, and simulation work  
- 📁 **/systems** — Control, signal, and system-level analysis  
- 📁 **/embedded** — Microcontroller and real-time system projects  
- 📁 **/math** — Engineering mathematics, models, and derivations  
- 📁 **/learning** — Educational resources and structured tutorials  

Each folder is designed to reflect real engineering workflows:  
from theory → to model → to implementation → to verification.

## Who This Is For

This repository is intended for:

- Engineering students tackling difficult, theory-heavy modules  
- Engineers looking for clean, well-structured technical examples  
- Clients interested in control, electrical, or embedded systems work  
- Anyone who believes engineering should be **understood**, not memorized
